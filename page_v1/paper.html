            In this paper, musical interfaces have developed by musicians and
            music company for audio processing, synthesizing and various
            performance. Developed musical interfaces had various features and
            musical timbre. But sound timbre generated by a computer without
            real acoustic instrument sound. To overcome this problem, Hybrid
            musical interface has developed to play with original sound timbre.
            Especially, saxophone interfaces of hybrid type can be attached or
            integrated into the real saxophone instrument. However, these
            interfaces have various problems such as constrained control and
            uncomfortable look from the complicated cords and controller with
            sensors. The purpose of this research is to overcome the problems
            and developing a hybrid saxophone interface with the natural
            gestures for live multimedia performance and interactive networking
            system.
