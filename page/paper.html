              Style of music has constantly been developed by musicians and
              information technologies. Especially, computer music has studied for
              synthesizing and audio processing on the web technologies with
              javascript that is a flexible language with a front and server-side
              capabilities, commonly, working dynamic interactions and networking.
              This paper aims an interactive web application development with a
              web audio library DrSax.js through the Web Audio API and can be
              separated into four parts.
              First, DrSax.js has developed as a web audio library, making it
              possible to speedy and easily make web applications to control
              interactive audio processing, sound effects, visualization, and media
              art. Normally, web audio applications need data to control UI and
              visualization, such as on/off buttons, dials, slides. So DrSax.js offers
              a number of functionalities that visualization and data control
              function.
              Second, this paper supports web code editor and debugging an
              application that is DrEditor supports variously preset for test and
              development.
              Third, DrWebSax is a multi-sound workstation for saxophone. It
              works that sound effects, processing, recorder, tuner for live
              interactive performance in real time.
              Last, Composition 2017 is a media art installation that is interactive
              web audio system using DrSax.js and Node.js with PC and mobile. A
              user can communicate and control images and sounds processing
              through other user’s application in real-time at various place. Also,
              users can access the web application with Wi-Fi or 3G, 4G data.
              This paper describes a web audio library and interactive web-audio
              system to control that audio processing, sound effects, visualization.
              This paper aims a faster and more effective interactive web
              application development through the audio library DrSax.js, which
              was developed using web technology for interactive multimedia
              contents.

            "SPIRIT" is a interactive multimedia music composition using a saxophone, sound effects and real-time processed visual image. This piece is controlled by saxophone that would be a composer, conductor and player at the same time. The goal of this study is to find the way of artistic expression by using sound and image.
                This system alters concept of music from listening music to watching music, and you provide a new hearing method to listeners. The sound of saxophone is computer analyzed and converted to data, and it used to change parameters of image of the works.
                Using a Max/MSP programs to analyze the sound of saxophone, and these programs used the sound as a data to apply to the image. A data which is an analysis of saxophone pitches converted to position of the image, an amplitude data of the saxophone converted to size of image, and FFT analysis data of saxophone is an analysis of amplitude per frequency converted to colors of the image. Quartz Composer used for image production that controlled by saxophone sound. In addition, delays and pitch of the saxophone sound effects were fabricated by changing the value. Saxophone sound is harmony with sound effects which controlled by foot controller.
                Researching this system, to analyze the sound of saxophone in real time is define a mutual relation between sound and image. Through such technology, the saxophone was able to control the music and image. In addition, the audience were able to easily sympathize with the meaning of work by multimedia element.

        The development of science and technology has enabled real-time interactive performances using multimedia contents, video and
music. These multimedia performances provide various kinds of spectacle to the audience with the genre fusion arts, and the
audience participate in the works and lead the performances by realtime interaction.
 It also uses computers and mobile-based, standalone applications to control media, video, and music in real time. However,
installable applications are not efficient in accessibility and compatibility, which limits the use of performance systems. In this
paper, we developed an interactive multimedia system using web technology with high accessibility. The audio system was implemented using HTML5 API and audio library DrSax.js, and the server was built with Node.js, an asynchronous method for
real-time interaction. We also used mobile sensors to control data through real-time interaction. We analyze the performance of
web audio application implemented through these features and investigate the efficiency of this study.</p>

        In this paper, musical interfaces have developed by musicians and music company for
        audio processing, synthesizing and various performance. Developed musical interfaces
        had various features and musical timbre. But sound timbre generated by a computer
        without real acoustic instrument sound. To overcome this problem, Hybrid musical
        interface has developed to play with original sound timbre. Especially, saxophone
        interfaces of hybrid type can be attached or integrated into the real saxophone instrument.
        However, these interfaces have various problems such as constrained control and
        uncomfortable look from the complicated cords and controller with sensors. The purpose
        of this research is to overcome the problems and developing a hybrid saxophone interface
        with the natural gestures for live multimedia performance and interactive networking
